### Two Player Mode 👥:
1. Two players take turns one after the other, making strategic moves to win the game.
2. The game will end when a player wins or the game results in a draw.
3. If all boxes are filled and no one wins, it's a draw.

### New Game:

2. Click on the **"New Game"** button to start over and clear the board.

### Reset:
